# Security Issues to Address

## Admin Location Endpoint Visibility

**Issue**: The admin location update form at `/admin/location` is visible in the public GitHub repository, making it discoverable by anyone who inspects the source code.

**Security Implications**:
- Anyone can find and access the location update form
- While not critically sensitive, it allows unauthorized location updates
- Could be used for spam or misinformation

**Potential Solutions**:
1. **Environment-based path**: Use Cloudflare Worker env variable for admin path
2. **Separate private repo**: Move admin functionality to private repository
3. **External admin tool**: Use external service that calls Worker API
4. **Simple auth**: Add basic password protection

**Priority**: Low - not critically sensitive data, but should be addressed for operational security.

**Status**: Currently accepting the risk for convenience, but should implement proper security before any sensitive admin features are added.
